# AutoQuests

AutoQuests is an engaging, browser-based incremental game where you embark on quests, level up your character, earn rewards, and upgrade your abilities. The game runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it automatically saves your progress using Local Storage.

## Features

- **Quest System:**  
  Start and upgrade quests with varying durations and rewards. Each quest has a required player level, and quests can be upgraded to earn more experience (XP) and gold.

- **Achievements:**  
  Unlock achievements based on your player level or quest upgrade levels. Each achievement rewards you with gold, XP, and occasionally diamonds when claimed.

- **Shop:**  
  Use diamonds to purchase items that provide boosts (such as extra gold, XP, or diamonds) for an enhanced gaming experience.

- **Dark Mode:**  
  The game uses a dark-themed design by default, offering a modern, visually appealing interface without gradients.

- **Save and Load:**  
  Your game progress is automatically saved in the browser's Local Storage. You can also export your save as a JSON file or import an existing save to continue your journey.

- **Auto-Repeat Quests:**  
  Once enabled, quests can automatically restart upon completion to maximize your progress.

## How to Play

1. **Overview:**  
   The Overview tab displays your current statistics including player level, XP, gold, diamonds, completed quests, and total gold earned.

2. **Quests:**  
   Navigate to the Quests tab to start new quests, upgrade existing ones, or toggle auto-repeat options. Each quest has its own duration and rewards.

3. **Achievements:**

4. **Shop:**  
   Visit the Shop tab to purchase items with diamonds. Items such as Gold Boost, XP Boost, and Diamond Boost provide in-game benefits.

5. **Settings:**  
   The Settings tab includes options for resetting the game, exporting your current save, and importing a save file.
